# JavaScript shorts cs50.

## Startup.

* To start writing JavqaScript, open up a file with the .js file extension.

* No need for any code delimiters like uou might be familiar with if you´ve used a lenguage like PHP. Ou website will kow that our file is  JavaScript because we´ll explicitly tell it as much i an HTML tag.

* JavaScript aplications run client-side, on your own machine, not server-side like python

## Objects.
* An object is sort of analogous to a C structure

* C Structures contain a number of different fields or members, which we might also call properties.
    * But the properties themselves can not ever stand on their own. (which means that they are part of a struct and you need to access its properties by . notation, not usig them just calling or declaring)

* Objects, meanwhile, have properties but also methods, or functions that are inherent to the object, and mean nothing outside of it.
    *Thus, like properties can methods not ever stand on their own.(entire functions could be written inside of the object)

```javascript
object.function();
```

* The fields and methods of an object are similar in spirit to the idea of a dictionary, just like with python
